## Key Technical Constraints

1. **Minimum Android Version**: API 35 (Android 15)
2. **Privacy-First**: No analytics, ads, or cloud services
3. **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM for backup/restore and local data storage
4. **Testing**: Maintain 90% code coverage
5. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance required

## Data Model

Subscriptions are stored using Protocol Buffers with the following key fields:
- Basic info: name, cost, currency, billing period
- Categories and tags for organization
- Renewal dates and notification settings
- Trial period tracking
- Custom notes

## Development Workflow

1. Create feature branch from main
2. Implement with TDD approach ✅ Applied to foundation
3. Ensure all quality checks pass
4. Submit PR with comprehensive tests
5. GitHub Actions will run CI pipeline

**Multi-Agent Development Process Used:**
- Agent O (Orchestrator): Strategic planning and architecture decisions
- Agent D (Developer): Complete implementation with zero incomplete code
- Agent R (Reviewer): Comprehensive validation and external benchmarking

## Important Implementation Notes

- Use `EncryptedProtobufSerializer` for all Proto DataStore implementations
- Follow Material Design 3 guidelines for all UI components
- Implement proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- Support both light and dark themes
- Ensure all strings are externalized for localization

## 🔄 Project Awareness & Context

- **Always read this `PLANNING.md`** at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's architecture, goals, and constraints
- **Check `/docs/workspaces/*`** for current implementation status and next priorities
- **Foundation is complete** - all core infrastructure, data layer, UI foundation, and navigation are implemented
- **Use consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns** as described in `PLANNING.md`
- **Follow the existing package structure** when adding new features or modules

## 🧱 Code Structure & Modularity

- **Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code.** If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into smaller, focused classes
- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**, grouped by feature or layer:
  - `data/` - Repository implementations, DataStore, Proto schemas
  - `domain/` - Use cases, domain models, business logic interfaces
  - `ui/` - Compose UI components, ViewModels, navigation
  - `di/` - Hilt modules and dependency injection setup
- **Each feature should have**:
  - `FeatureViewModel.kt` - ViewModel with UI state management
  - `FeatureScreen.kt` - Compose UI implementation
  - `FeatureRepository.kt` - Data layer implementation
  - `FeatureUseCase.kt` - Business logic (when needed)
- **Use consistent package imports** (prefer explicit imports over wildcards)

## 🧪 Testing & Reliability ✅ Foundation Tests Complete

- **Always create unit tests for new features** (ViewModels, repositories, use cases)
- **After updating any logic**, check whether existing unit tests need to be updated
- **Test structure mirrors the main source structure** ✅ Implemented:
  ```
  app/src/test/java/com/subcontrol/
  ├── data/
  │   ├── datastore/EncryptionManagerTest.kt     # ✅ Encryption tests
  │   └── repository/SubscriptionRepositoryImplTest.kt # ✅ Repository tests
  └── ui/screens/subscription/
      ├── SubscriptionListViewModelTest.kt       # ✅ List ViewModel tests
      └── SubscriptionEditViewModelTest.kt       # ✅ Edit ViewModel tests
  ```
- **Each test class should include**:
  - At least 1 test for expected behavior
  - Edge case tests (empty data, null values)
  - Error/failure case tests
  - Use `MockK` for mocking dependencies
  - Use `Turbine` for testing Flows
- **UI tests** should be in `androidTest/` using Compose testing APIs

## ✅ Task Management

- **Track progress in `docs/workspaces/task-plan-01-14-18-10-00.md`**
- **Foundation Phase Complete** (13/36 tasks): ✅
  - Project setup, Proto schemas, Hilt DI
  - Data layer with AES-256-GCM encryption
  - Navigation, theming, subscription management UI
  - Comprehensive test coverage for completed features
- **Next Priority: Phase 2 - Business Logic & Analytics**
  - Use cases implementation
  - Dashboard UI with cost summaries
  - Analytics engine and notification system
- **Include dates** when adding or completing tasks for tracking progress

## 📎 Style & Conventions

- **Use Kotlin** as the primary language with idiomatic patterns
- **Follow Kotlin coding conventions** and Android best practices
- **Use Ktlint** for code formatting (run `./gradlew ktlintFormat`)
- **Apply these patterns**:
  - Immutable data classes for models
  - Sealed classes for state representation
  - Extension functions for cleaner APIs
  - Coroutines for async operations
  - StateFlow for UI state
  - Flow for data streams
- **Write KDoc comments for public APIs**:
  ```kotlin
  /**
   * Calculates the total monthly cost of all active subscriptions.
   *
   * @param subscriptions List of user subscriptions
   * @param currency Target currency for conversion
   * @return Total monthly cost in the specified currency
   */
  fun calculateMonthlyCost(
      subscriptions: List<Subscription>,
      currency: Currency
  ): BigDecimal
  ```

## 📚 Documentation & Explainability

- **Update `README.md`** when new features are added or setup steps change
- **Comment complex business logic** with `// Explanation:` comments
- **Document architectural decisions** in code when deviating from standard patterns
- **Keep inline documentation concise** but helpful for future developers
- **Update this `CLAUDE.md`** if new patterns or practices are established
- **Always update `LEARNINGS.md`** when you solved a bug or error, to not run into them again in future

## 🧠 AI Behavior Rules

- **Never assume missing context** - Ask questions if requirements are unclear
- **Never hallucinate libraries or APIs** - Only use verified Android/Kotlin libraries
- **Always verify file paths and package names** exist before referencing them
- **Never delete or overwrite existing code** unless explicitly instructed or fixing bugs
- **Check for existing implementations** before creating new files or functions
- **Respect the privacy-first approach** - Never add analytics, ads, or cloud services
- **Follow TDD when possible** - Write tests first for new features
